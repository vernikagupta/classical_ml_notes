                         5. 5. Tricky Interview Questions - Deep understanding tests
                           
                            6. Why Start Here?
                            7. Linear Regression teaches the fundamental geometric intuitions that underlie all of machine learning. Understanding projections, loss surfaces, and the bias-variance decomposition prepares you for everything that follows.

                            9. - Least squares as projection onto column space
                               - - Loss surface geometry and optimization
                                 - - Bias-variance-irreducible error decomposition
                                   - - Overfitting and regularization foundations
                                     - - Conditioning number and ill-posed problems
