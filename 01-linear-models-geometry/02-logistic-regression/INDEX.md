                            6. Why Logistic Regression?
                            7. This chapter bridges Linear Regression and probabilistic thinking. By extending the geometric framework to probability, you develop the intuition needed for all probabilistic models. The cross-entropy loss and gradient structure appear everywhere in ML.
