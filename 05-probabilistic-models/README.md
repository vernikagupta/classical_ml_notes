  - ## Why This Order?
 
  - Bayesian Decision Theory formalizes uncertainty and optimal decisions from first principles. GMM & EM combine probabilistic modeling with unsupervised learning, using both E-step (geometry) and M-step (optimization), serving as a bridge to modern VAEs and diffusion models.
