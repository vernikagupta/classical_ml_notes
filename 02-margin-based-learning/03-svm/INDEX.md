SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES

Chapter 3 - Margin-Based Classification

Topics:
- Margin concept and geometric interpretation
- - Hard and soft margins
  - - Kernel trick and kernel methods
    - - Duality in optimization
      - - Support vectors and sparse solutions
        - - Kernel selection and design
          - - Real-world applications

              - Why SVM?
              - After linear models and probabilities, SVMs introduce pure geometric thinking through margins without explicit probabilities. This prepares you for kernel methods used throughout ML.
